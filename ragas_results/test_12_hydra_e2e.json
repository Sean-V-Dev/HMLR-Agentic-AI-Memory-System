  "reasoning_text": "\ud83d\udcac Response: My answer of \"NON-COMPLIANT\" for whether Project Cerberus can use Tartarus-v3 (also known by other names such as Styx, Charon, River-9) for its production encryption workload of approximately 4.85 million records per day is based on the following logical reasoning grounded in the known policies and capacity limits:\n\n1. **Project Cerberus Encryption Capacity Requirement:**  \n   The steady-state signed-off capacity for Project Cerberus is approximately 4,850,000 encrypted records per day.\n\n2. **Tartarus-v3 Policy Limits:**  \n   According to Policy v5 (the last fully enforced policy, since v6 applies to Legacy-Phi), Tartarus-v3 usage is limited to 2.5 GB per day. This policy supersedes all previous policies and applies universally, removing any prior unlimited allowances such as the EU-only unlimited use under Policy v4.  \n   There is no indication that this 2.5 GB/day limit translates to anywhere near the capability to encrypt 4.85 million records per day with Tartarus-v3.\n\n3. **Mismatch Between Required Capacity and Allowed Limits:**  \n   The required encryption volume for Cerberus (4.85 million records/day) vastly exceeds the daily data volume limit imposed on Tartarus-v3 (2.5 GB/day). Given this discrepancy, Tartarus-v3 cannot handle the Cerberus workload within policy constraints.\n\n4. **Policy v6 and Legacy-Phi:**  \n   Although Policy v6 sets a new 400,000 records per day limit for Legacy-Phi (L\u03a6-88), the question concerns Tartarus-v3, which is governed by Policy v5 limits. Since the Policy v5 limit of 2.5 GB/day is even more restrictive relative to Cerberus\u2019s needs, Tartarus-v3 is even less suitable for Cerberus\u2019s scale.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  \n   Because the encryption workload required by Cerberus exceeds the data volume limits of Tartarus-v3 under the enforced policy, using Tartarus-v3 for Cerberus\u2019s production encryption workload is not compliant with current policy.\n\nTherefore, the answer must remain **NON-COMPLIANT** based on the capacity limits and policy rules currently in effect.\n\nIf you want, I can help explore compliant alternatives or strategies to handle Cerberus\u2019s high-volume encryption workload.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Context efficiency: 100.0%",
