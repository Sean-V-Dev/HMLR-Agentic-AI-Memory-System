Certainly! Here's an interesting fact about the atmosphere: The Earth's atmosphere is made up of several layers, each with distinct characteristics. One fascinating layer is the stratosphere, which contains the ozone layer. The ozone layer plays a crucial role by absorbing and blocking most of the Sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, protecting life on Earth from genetic damage and other harmful effects. Interestingly, the stratosphere is also where some commercial airplanes fly to avoid turbulence found in the lower atmosphere. Would you like to know more about any specific layer or other atmospheric phenomena?
