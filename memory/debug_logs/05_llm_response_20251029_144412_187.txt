Certainly! Here's an interesting fact about mountains: Mountains can actually "grow" and change shape over time due to geological processes. For example, the Himalayas—the tallest mountain range in the world—are still rising at a rate of about 1 centimeter per year. This is because the Indian tectonic plate is slowly pushing northward into the Eurasian plate, causing the Earth's crust to buckle and form these towering peaks. So, mountains are not just static features; they're dynamic and constantly evolving! Would you like to learn more about a specific mountain or mountain range?
