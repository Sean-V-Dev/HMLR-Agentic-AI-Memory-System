Yes! Earlier today, I shared some advice about getting started with LeetCode, especially for someone new to coding. Here's a quick summary of what I mentioned: - **Learn a programming language well:** Choose one commonly used on LeetCode, like Python, Java, or C++, and get comfortable with its syntax and basic features. - **Understand fundamentals:** Focus on key data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, hash maps) and algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion). - **Practice consistently:** Solve problems regularly, starting with easy ones and gradually moving to medium and hard difficulties. - **Study problem patterns:** Over time, recognize common problem types and techniques (two pointers, sliding window, dynamic programming). - **Use resources:** Leverage online tutorials, discussion forums, and solutions to learn different approaches. If you'd like, I can help you create a step-by-step plan or recommend some beginner-friendly LeetCode problems to start with!
