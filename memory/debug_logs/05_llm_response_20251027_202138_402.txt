Sure! Here's an interesting science fact: Did you know that water can exist in all three states of matter—solid, liquid, and gas—at the same time? This is called the **triple point** of water. It occurs at a very specific temperature and pressure (0.01°C and 611.657 pascals). At this point, ice, liquid water, and water vapor coexist in equilibrium. This phenomenon is used to calibrate thermometers because it's such a precise and reproducible condition! Would you like to hear another science fact or learn more about this one?
