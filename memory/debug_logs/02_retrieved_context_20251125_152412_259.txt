User: Im testing a memory system, as part of your prompt, other than this one, did you receive a user profile glossary that mentioned thing like HMLR, cognitive lattice, and Blue Sky?
Assistant: Yes, I have received your user profile glossary mentioning HMLR (Hierarchical Memory & Lattice Retrieval), Cognitive Lattice, and Blue Sky as your cleaning business. These entries are part of your active projects and entities, which I can use to provide more personalized and context-aware responses. If you want, I can help you test or develop the memory system further with this context in mind.
