Certainly! Here's an interesting fact about cars: The world's first practical automobile powered by an internal combustion engine was built by Karl Benz in 1885. Known as the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, it had three wheels and a top speed of about 16 km/h (10 mph). This invention kickstarted the modern automotive industry and changed transportation forever. Today’s cars have evolved tremendously, with electric and hybrid models becoming increasingly popular as technology advances toward more sustainable mobility.
