User: Im testing a memory system, as part of your prompt, other than this one, did you receive a user profile glossary that mentioned thing like HMLR, cognitive lattice, and Blue Sky?

User: Did the new glossary show that i have a job at anthem?
AI: No, the current glossary you shared does not show any job or role at Anthem. It only includes your projects (HMLR and Cognitive Lattice), your business (Blue Sky), and your coding style preferences. If you want, I can help you add your Anthem role to the glossary for future reference. Would you like to do that?
