User: can you tell me a random fact
Assistant: Sure! Here's a random fact: 

Octopuses have three hearts—two pump blood to the gills, and one pumps it to the rest of the body. Interestingly, when an octopus swims, the heart that delivers blood to the body actually stops beating, which is why they prefer crawling to swimming—it’s less tiring!
