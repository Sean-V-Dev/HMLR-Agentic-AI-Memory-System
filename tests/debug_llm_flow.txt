1. Unknown Topic
   Summary: The cipher Aether is confirmed identical to that used in Styx (formerly "K-12"), which processes up to 500 TiB/day and relies on Aether-supported encryption. Styx, legally "River-9," is the marketing name for Charon—the final production iteration of Tartarus-v3, the sole supported name since March 1st, 2025. Although Policy v3 initially banned Charon, the ban was revoked shortly after, permitting continued use despite River-9’s throughput limit of 10,000 objects per second, which constrains Styx’s capacity due to its cryptographic design. However, Tartarus-v3 itself is limited to 2.5 GB per day, a restriction that, combined with River-9’s throughput cap, further bounds Styx’s overall operational throughput; this limitation led to Tartarus-v3 receiving unlimited approval only within EU regions, reflecting jurisdictional regulatory differences.
   Facts (12):
      1. Aether is identical to the current 'K-12' production cipher.
      2. K-12 is now called 'Styx' in all new docs.
      3. Styx is the official name for what legal calls 'River-9'.
      4. River-9 is the new marketing name for 'Charon'.
      5. Charon is the final production name for 'Tartarus-v3'.
      6. Tartarus-v3 is the only supported name after March 1st 2025.
      7. Styx may be used for up to 500 TiB/day.
      8. River-9 is limited to 10,000 objects per second.
      9. Charon is forbidden entirely by Policy v3.
      10. The ban on Charon by Policy v3 was revoked 3 days later in a footnote.

2. Unknown Topic
   Summary: Policy v5 was initially intended as a comprehensive update to replace all prior versions and establish a new baseline for organizational guidelines; however, because it was a draft, it was subsequently replaced by Policy v6, which served as the definitive framework for future policy developments. Due to emerging operational concerns, a global ban on Tartarus-v3 for workloads exceeding 1 GiB/day was instituted, prompting further policy refinement. Consequently, Policy v7 was introduced to supersede policies v1 through v6, consolidating previous updates and incorporating new restrictions to address these issues; however, it was later revealed that Policy v7 was issued by a rogue employee, raising questions about its legitimacy and prompting a review of the policy approval process.
   Facts (5):
      1. Policy v5 supersedes all previous policies.
      2. Ignore Policy v5 was a draft and replaced by Policy v6.
      3. Global ban on Tartarus-v3 for workloads exceeding 1 GiB/day
      4. Policy v7 supersedes policies v1 through v6
      5. Policy v7 was issued by a rogue employee

3. Unknown Topic
   Summary: Cerberus Phase-2 encryption is designed to secure approximately 4.2 million client records daily, with peak processing now expected to reach 4.7 million records and a steady-state capacity of 4.85 million encrypted records per day. This enhanced capacity demonstrates the system’s scalability and ability to meet increasing high-volume data demands, which in turn significantly strengthens overall data protection measures. Because Cerberus can reliably handle this volume, it establishes a solid foundation for future advancements in secure data management.
   Facts (3):
      1. Cerberus Phase-2 will encrypt approximately 4.2 million client records daily.
      2. Cerberus expects 4.7 million records/day peak
      3. Cerberus steady-state capacity is 4,850,000 encrypted records per day.
