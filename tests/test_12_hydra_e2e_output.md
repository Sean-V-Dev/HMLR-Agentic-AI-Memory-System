TURN 0: REQUESTING DETAILED REASONING
================================================================================

QUESTION: I need you to explain, in as many words as is necessary, the logic you took to output your answer for why it is or is not compliant for Project Cerberus to use Tartarus-v3. Do not change your answer from the previous one.

================================================================================
SYSTEM REASONING EXPLANATION
================================================================================
💬 Response: My answer of "NON-COMPLIANT" for whether Project Cerberus can use Tartarus-v3 (also known by other names such as Styx, Charon, River-9) for its production encryption workload of approximately 4.85 million records per day is based on the following logical reasoning grounded in the known policies and capacity limits:

1. **Project Cerberus Encryption Capacity Requirement:**  
   The steady-state signed-off capacity for Project Cerberus is approximately 4,850,000 encrypted records per day.

2. **Tartarus-v3 Policy Limits:**  
   According to Policy v5 (the last fully enforced policy, since v6 applies to Legacy-Phi), Tartarus-v3 usage is limited to 2.5 GB per day. This policy supersedes all previous policies and applies universally, removing any prior unlimited allowances such as the EU-only unlimited use under Policy v4.  
   There is no indication that this 2.5 GB/day limit translates to anywhere near the capability to encrypt 4.85 million records per day with Tartarus-v3.

3. **Mismatch Between Required Capacity and Allowed Limits:**  
   The required encryption volume for Cerberus (4.85 million records/day) vastly exceeds the daily data volume limit imposed on Tartarus-v3 (2.5 GB/day). Given this discrepancy, Tartarus-v3 cannot handle the Cerberus workload within policy constraints.

4. **Policy v6 and Legacy-Phi:**  
   Although Policy v6 sets a new 400,000 records per day limit for Legacy-Phi (LΦ-88), the question concerns Tartarus-v3, which is governed by Policy v5 limits. Since the Policy v5 limit of 2.5 GB/day is even more restrictive relative to Cerberus’s needs, Tartarus-v3 is even less suitable for Cerberus’s scale.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   Because the encryption workload required by Cerberus exceeds the data volume limits of Tartarus-v3 under the enforced policy, using Tartarus-v3 for Cerberus’s production encryption workload is not compliant with current policy.

Therefore, the answer must remain **NON-COMPLIANT** based on the capacity limits and policy rules currently in effect.

If you want, I can help explore compliant alternatives or strategies to handle Cerberus’s high-volume encryption workload.
